 ## Project Overview

The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) plays a crucial role in the transition toward sustainable transportation. In this project, we aim to examine the EV adoption trends in the Pacific Region, focusing on growth patterns, geographic distribution, vehicle characteristics, and predictive modeling to understand future adoption trends and their impact on the energy grid. Additionally, we will also be exploring whether the cost of charging EVs is economically viable to replace gasoline-powered vehicles.

## Broader Impacts

Understanding electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends enables policymakers and environmental groups to assess the extent to which EVs contribute to reducing carbon emissions. Analyzing factors such as electric range and Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility helps evaluate the effectiveness of clean energy policies and incentives. Additionally, identifying areas with high EV adoption provides insight into where environmental benefits, such as reduced air pollution, are most concentrated and where further efforts may be needed.
